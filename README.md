### Hi there, I'm Marc. üëã

I welcome you to my humble abode. I know this isn't social media but let me introduce myself. I'm Marc, a software engineer based in New York City. Born and raised in New York, I've gotten to meet many very interesting people and I hope I can meet with you as well, on my github profile you'll find several projects I'm interested in or working on. I got my coding start in middle school when I tried to design a flash games website using a web builder, so that other students could get around the schools firewall to play games. After that, I wanted to know how the web builders built the site and took to learning HTML4 (yup!). Afterwords I learned about HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. Then I wanted to make video games, so I ended up learning quite a bit of C++. I was hooked on the web design world though. I'd spend afternoons learning after school about web development, where eventually in high school. I picked up my first job and learned about PHP, APIs, MYSQL, requirements gathering, and much more. I slowly worked toward learning new technologies, litle-by-little.
